# Machine-Learning-Classification-Model-comparison
Comparison of logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees on a classification dataset, including feature transformation and performance evaluation.

# 

This project applies and compares multiple machine learning models 
(logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees) on a real-world 
classification dataset. The analysis includes data preparation, feature 
transformation, model evaluation, and performance comparison using standard 
classification metrics.
