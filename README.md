# Machine Learning Classification Model Comparison

Implementation and comparison of multiple classification models on a real-world dataset.
Logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees are evaluated using consistent
metrics to analyze model performance and tradeoffs.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Supervised classification
- Feature preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Precision, recall, and F1-score comparison
- Model interpretability vs complexity tradeoffs
